# Java-XML

Hello and welcome!
This repository contains an XML file managed by myself in order to use with grabbing the latest and older versions of Java via script. I have alerts as to when an update is posted so this XML will always be up to date.

If you would like to learn more on how to use this XML with your script, please don't hesitate to contact me via [email](mailto:david@mearkats.co.uk) and I'll get back to you as soon as I can!

If this XML helped you, please give it a star to show your appreciation.
